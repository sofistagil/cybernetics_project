# cybernetics_project_roots
Device that reproduces audio from nature stories 

#PROJECT DEVELOPED AS PART OF "DEMO DAY", DURING THE MASTER OF APPLIED CYBERNETICS AT ANU 2022

#Native and aboriginal communities all around the world have this special view of nature not as something, but as someone who takes care of us and to whom be grateful.

Roots (this device) uses audio and GPS location to tell you the stories of nature and deities in your surroundings. Reminding you that no matter how many high buildings we build. We are always still part of nature.



Root, is a wearable device, designed in the form of a glove. It finds your GPS location, then
offers to tell you the stories and myths that belong to the place where you are, as myths
usually come from Native communities and cultures that respect and care for nature. These
stories and myths are usually about nature as well. Root will tell you stories from the place
where you are, and the more you walk into places with nature, the more stories you are
allowed to hear.
